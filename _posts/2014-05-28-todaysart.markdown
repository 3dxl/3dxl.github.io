The municipality of The Hague (Den Haag) made the final decision to build the 'Spuiforum' designed by Neutelings Riedijk (http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2013/11/01/haagse-gemeenteraad-stemt-toch-nog-in-met-cultuurpaleis-spuiforum/). The foam sculpture of Frank Loer and Arnoud Herder presented on TodaysArt still wonders why, referring to historical precedents that we favour.
